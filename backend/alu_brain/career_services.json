      "question": "How does the internship program work?",
      "answer": "ALU's internship program is an integral part of the academic experience. Students are required to complete at least one substantive internship before graduation, typically during the summer between academic years. The Career Development Office helps match students with opportunities aligned with their career goals and academic focus. ALU has partnerships with companies across Africa and globally, providing students with diverse options. Internships are credit-bearing, requiring students to complete academic reflections and projects connecting their practical experience to their classroom learning."
