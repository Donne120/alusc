      "question": "How is ALU's curriculum structured?",
<<<<<<< HEAD
      "answer": "ALU's curriculum is structured around a leadership core that all students take regardless of their degree program. This core focuses on developing entrepreneurial leadership skills, critical thinking, and communication abilities. Beyond the core, students specialize in their chosen field through major-specific courses.\n\nThe curriculum follows a four-year structure with increasing specialization each year. First-year students focus on foundational skills and the leadership core. Second-year introduces more specialized courses in their chosen field. Third and fourth years combine deep disciplinary knowledge with practical projects, internships, and a final capstone project that demonstrates their learning and impact.\n\nUnlike traditional universities, ALU emphasizes practical, project-based learning over theoretical lectures. Students work on real-world challenges, often in collaboration with industry partners and communities."
=======
      "answer": "ALU's curriculum is designed to develop innovative leaders through a blend of rigorous academic coursework and real-world experiences. It is divided into three main components: a foundational leadership core completed in the first year, major-specific courses that build in-depth disciplinary expertise, and culminating integrative capstone projects that emphasize practical problem solving and collaboration with industry partners. This structure ensures that graduates have both theoretical knowledge and practical skills."
